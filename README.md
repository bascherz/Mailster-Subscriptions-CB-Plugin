# Mailster Subscriptions Community Builder Plugin
Joomla! extension for Community Builder that provides simple website subscriptions to Mailster email lists in user profiles.

A refactoring of my decade-old Dada Mail Subscriptions CB Plugin, the Mailster Subscriptions CB Plugin provides a simple and intuitive way for site users to subscribe to your Mailster email lists. The administrator interface is identical to that of the Dada Mail version. **The Administrator Guide attached here** provides the details on how it works and how you can make it look in your user profiles.

Although this plugin was developed on a Joomla! 4.2.4 site, it should work properly on a Joomla! 3 site also. It just hasn't been tested on one. CB plugins are easy to migrate to new versions of Joomla! because the CB API really never changes.

Enjoy!
